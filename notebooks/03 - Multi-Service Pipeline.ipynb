For the price point, I think it's a great value. It has taken quite a pounding over gravel road tours, and no mechanical issues. The steel frame handles weight well, and offers shock absorbency on long rides. I did swap out the tires for Schwalbe Marathons, which are heavier - but I've never had a flat on them and they hold pressure extremely well."

I took this bike for a test ride at the Denver Flagship store and didn't bother to test ride the Surly (which REI doesn't carry). This bike was $500 cheaper and had default gearing more suited to my 62 year old knees. I'm planning to climb some hills (I'm working up to climbing Lookout Mountain west of Denver) and so far have had no issues with the bike. It rides as smoothly as my previous ride, a Jamis Coda Comp with 700c x 28mm tires. This bike with it's 650b x 50mm tires absorbs the bumps of pavement and gravel and dare I say, seems to ride just as smoothly on pavement as my old Jamis. Well done, REI designers!"

This bike was $500 cheaper and had default gearing more suited to my 62 year old knees. I'm planning to climb some hills (I'm working up to climbing Lookout Mountain west of Denver) and so far have had no issues with the bike. It rides as smoothly as my previous ride, a Jamis Coda Comp with 700c x 28mm tires. This bike with it's 650b x 50mm tires absorbs the bumps of pavement and gravel and dare I say, seems to ride just as smoothly on pavement as my old Jamis. Well done, REI designers!",

My load is considerably small compared to other people I've met on the road. Without food and water about 30-35 pounds. Also it's the second bike I got from REI, since one of the threads to attach the bike rack in the back broke right at the beginning. They aren't welded in, just riveted. So the thread just started to turn in its own spot. REI told me to bring the bike in, but since I'm actually using it for bike touring and I'm in South America, that's impossible. So I can just hope it won't make any more problems on the way.",

During that time I had 7 broken spokes in the back and 2 in the front. I eventually decided to replace all spokes. So far no more broken spokes. My load is considerably small compared to other people I've met on the road. Without food and water about 30-35 pounds. Also it's the second bike I got from REI, since one of the threads to attach the bike rack in the back broke right at the beginning. They aren't welded in, just riveted. So the thread just started to turn in its own spot. REI told me to bring the bike in, but since I'm actually using it for bike touring and I'm in South America, that's impossible. So I can just hope it won't make any more problems on the way.",

I've been cycling both as a means of commuting and recreation/fitness for many years and while the majority of my miles were done on a downtube-shifter road bike from the 80s and a couple mountain bike frames with slick tires, I've also spent several hundred miles on my dad's Cannondale CAAD8, which is a more modern aluminum road bike. I bought this Journeyman as a commuter / possible touring bike and to replace my current day-to-day bike, a cheap Giant Defy 3 hybrid frame (with 700c tires) -- but unfortunately the Journeyman was much heavier and considerably slower. My daily commutes (about 18 miles each way on very flat Orange County bike paths) averaged several minutes slower each way on this bike than my Giant (which I picked up used for only $150) and there really was no contest when compared to my friend's budget ~$500 Fuji road bike. This was quite a disappointment given that as a gravel bike the Journeyman is touted as being equally-capable on the road. It's possible that swapping the tires for something slicker / less knobby would improve it's speed, but obviously this takes away from its off-road capabilities (unless you own a second wheelset for quick changes) and I didn't really see this as any guarantee that the bike would improve to meet my needs, as the frame itself is rather heavy. I ended up returning the bike after a few weeks (thanks to REI's generous return policy) -- it was hard to justify keeping it when it didn't perform as well as what I already had. Instead of a nice 'all-in-one' bike I think I may pick up a dedicated road bike for commuting and fitness rides and a cheaper mountain bike for playing around on the trails on the weekends.",

I've been cycling both as a means of commuting and recreation/fitness for many years and while the majority of my miles were done on a downtube-shifter road bike from the 80s and a couple mountain bike frames with slick tires, I've also spent several hundred miles on my dad's Cannondale CAAD8, which is a more modern aluminum road bike. I bought this Journeyman as a commuter / possible touring bike and to replace my current day-to-day bike, a cheap Giant Defy 3 hybrid frame (with 700c tires) -- but unfortunately the Journeyman was much heavier and considerably slower. My daily commutes (about 18 miles each way on very flat Orange County bike paths) averaged several minutes slower each way on this bike than my Giant (which I picked up used for only $150) and there really was no contest when compared to my friend's budget ~$500 Fuji road bike. This was quite a disappointment given that as a gravel bike the Journeyman is touted as being equally-capable on the road. It's possible that swapping the tires for something slicker / less knobby would improve it's speed, but obviously this takes away from its off-road capabilities (unless you own a second wheelset for quick changes) and I didn't really see this as any guarantee that the bike would improve to meet my needs, as the frame itself is rather heavy.

This has to be the most comfortable Road Bike that I've ridden by far. I'm still not accustomed to riding Road Bikes but the Journeyman does allow me to go the distance without experience too much lower back pain. I didn't used to be a fan of riding in the drops - mainly because of lower back pain - but on this bike, I did not feel any discomfort riding in the drops and it certainly makes riding into the wind much less taxing. It is not the fastest bike in my stable. The wider tires certainly creates more rolling resistance, however riding over the rough road surfaces of the Greater Cleveland Area with these wider tires creates an almost plush ride. I will gladly take the tradeoff in speed for the added comfort. I purchased this bike to use a winter commuter. It has all the braze-ons you could ever need for mounting accessories. I specifically like the braze-ons on the top tube. I mounted an anything carrier to the top tube to carry my JBL Charge 3 speaker. Perhaps my favorite thing about this bike will be the 650b tires. Because of my long legs I tend to put the seat up fairly high to allow me more power when I peddle. The smaller wheel diameter means I can comfortably pant my foot on the ground when I'm stopped at lights and not feel like I'm going to tip over.",

It comes equipped with everything you need to hit the trails. I recently took out the stock tires and added Maxxis DHR II and DHF (Tubeless) just by doing that the bike traction has been great. I've had the bike for over a month and absolutely love it. With that said I would give it a 3.5/5 just because it's more of a bike to upgrade with rather than sticking with the stocked parts. My chain got stiff links just within a couple weeks. Front and rear shocks are just fine.",

After advising I should purchase a pump for the air suspension, I had a simple question for the person at the bike shop desk. “I don’t know. I’m not a mountain biker.” Was how it was answered, with no follow up. Not exactly what I expected from an REI employee. Fast forward a month and about 8 hours of trail later, the bike is almost unusable. What may be a problem with the chain is causing slippage and near constant missed shifts. Brake caliper bolts were found to be loose, judging by loctite on the threads, it seems they were never torqued or even tightened. There is creaking coming from what may be the bottom bracket and excessive side to side play in the rear wheel. I still hope to get this bike dialed in and am disappointed I need to set aside a day to bring it back and get the chain issue taken care of, just to be able to get enough time on it to make a review of the actual product, as I suspect properly assembled it would rate a 4/5.",

After advising I should purchase a pump for the air suspension, I had a simple question for the person at the bike shop desk. “I don’t know. I’m not a mountain biker.” Was how it was answered, with no follow up. Not exactly what I expected from an REI employee. Fast forward a month and about 8 hours of trail later, the bike is almost unusable. What may be a problem with the chain is causing slippage and near constant missed shifts. Brake caliper bolts were found to be loose, judging by loctite on the threads, it seems they were never torqued or even tightened. There is creaking coming from what may be the bottom bracket and excessive side to side play in the rear wheel. I still hope to get this bike dialed in and am disappointed I need to set aside a day to bring it back and get the chain issue taken care of, just to be able to get enough time on it to make a review of the actual product, as I suspect properly assembled it would rate a 4/5.",

Handlebar is narrower (740) than I'm used to (780) which in theory should make riding through tight trees.easier, but in practice the longer bar is easier to control anyway so it's easier to lean the bike to fit through. The gear range is quite limited with only 28 front and 11-42 in the back. The brakes would probably be the first to get upgraded. Nowhere near the 1-finger ease and strong bite of the XT brakes I have on my older bike. The rear shock's metal valve sticks out just enough where you can hit your knee or thigh on it on dismounts. I have already scratched my thigh on it on the first ride. The metal is pretty sharp and is also a problem on the 3.2 bike which is basically the same frame. My son has also cut his knee on the shock valve of his 3.2. The front fork makes a loud squishing sound on quick decompression which you will hear when lifting up the front wheel to ride over logs for example. Not really that bothersome amidst all the sounds of riding on the trail. At least the tires roll relatively quietly. The cable routing with the big hanging loop under the bottom bracket looks like it could snag on rocks or logs. Haven't been a problem so far but the cables do catch a lot of mud and dirt. This is the same frame (and tires and rear shock and seatpost and seat and handlebars) as the 3.2 bike. It has modern frame geometry that would be a good base for upgrades. If you're thinking of upgrading to better than the 3.2 spec or you just like the grey/black color better, this would be the better option. If you don't have upgrade plans, the 3.2 bike would be the better choice. I think the price difference easily justifies the much better fork, and the better gearing and brakes.",

Handlebar is narrower (740) than I'm used to (780) which in theory should make riding through tight trees.easier, but in practice the longer bar is easier to control anyway so it's easier to lean the bike to fit through. The gear range is quite limited with only 28 front and 11-42 in the back. The brakes would probably be the first to get upgraded. Nowhere near the 1-finger ease and strong bite of the XT brakes I have on my older bike. The rear shock's metal valve sticks out just enough where you can hit your knee or thigh on it on dismounts. I have already scratched my thigh on it on the first ride. The metal is pretty sharp and is also a problem on the 3.2 bike which is basically the same frame. My son has also cut his knee on the shock valve of his 3.2. The front fork makes a loud squishing sound on quick decompression which you will hear when lifting up the front wheel to ride over logs for example. Not really that bothersome amidst all the sounds of riding on the trail. At least the tires roll relatively quietly. The cable routing with the big hanging loop under the bottom bracket looks like it could snag on rocks or logs. Haven't been a problem so far but the cables do catch a lot of mud and dirt. This is the same frame (and tires and rear shock and seatpost and seat and handlebars) as the 3.2 bike. It has modern frame geometry that would be a good base for upgrades.

After another ride and still having to listen to the creaking I had to swap that particular bike for another one of the same model. After 30+ miles on the new bike, no creaking. After reading some of the other reviews, it \"\"sounds\"\" like this model has a noise issue. So be warned/prepared. The bike has been the best bike I have ever owned and the riding has been the best ever with this bike. I can blast up and down hills that I couldn't with my hardtail. I love the gearing and the shifters are great. It gets 4/5 due to the fact that the bike had some small issues that couldn't get worked out combined with the fact that others are having similar issues.\"",

Sure, the bike will (hopefully) get scratched and dinged on all the adventures I’ll have, but it’s good to start with a clean slate, especially when you’re dropping $2k on a ride. Anyway, as Salsa don’t sell touch up paints (why not?) I went to Michael’s and bought a basic enamel paint set. Mixed up the color to match and boom. All fixed!

The bike really rolls and the plus tires are confidence building. I foolishly didn’t properly check the bike when I picked it up so didn’t notice the chipped frame down by the rear dropout. Once I took it home there’s no way I could prove it wasn’t me (it wasn’t). Sure, the bike will (hopefully) get scratched and dinged on all the adventures I’ll have, but it’s good to start with a clean slate, especially when you’re dropping $2k on a ride.

I was tired of being attached to a heavy battery, but I was afraid of missing the speed to return to a regular bike. This Salsa leaves nothing to be desired. It is fast, smooth, agile, and seems bulletproof. I took on a 25 mic spin the first night and fell in love. An unrelated river accident left me with a torn ACL, so I was out of service after surgery for the last week or two. But once I'm healthy again, I'll put on my salsa. My wife and I are planning a bike packing trip for once I'm 100%. This bike will be perfect for her.",

This bike was $500 cheaper and had default gearing more suited to my 62 year old knees. I'm planning to climb some hills (I'm working up to climbing Lookout Mountain west of Denver) and so far have had no issues with the bike. It rides as smoothly as my previous ride, a Jamis Coda Comp with 700c x 28mm tires. This bike with it's 650b x 50mm tires absorbs the bumps of pavement and gravel and dare I say, seems to ride just as smoothly on pavement as my old Jamis. Well done, REI designers!",

This bike has excelled on paved greenway paths, gravel paths, and somewhat rocky terrain. We went full speed down the mountain and it handled it like a champ. Only one flat tire and no actual issues with the bike itself. The only upgrades I’ve done so far is pedals and a Brooks saddle. I added a rack to the back for a bag and it didn’t throw off the balance too much. No complaints at all!!",

My load is considerably small compared to other people I've met on the road. Without food and water about 30-35 pounds. Also it's the second bike I got from REI, since one of the threads to attach the bike rack in the back broke right at the beginning. They aren't welded in, just riveted. So the thread just started to turn in its own spot. REI told me to bring the bike in, but since I'm actually using it for bike touring and I'm in South America, that's impossible. So I can just hope it won't make any more problems on the way.",

My load is considerably small compared to other people I've met on the road. Without food and water about 30-35 pounds. Also it's the second bike I got from REI, since one of the threads to attach the bike rack in the back broke right at the beginning. They aren't welded in, just riveted.

I've been cycling both as a means of commuting and recreation/fitness for many years and while the majority of my miles were done on a downtube-shifter road bike from the 80s and a couple mountain bike frames with slick tires, I've also spent several hundred miles on my dad's Cannondale CAAD8, which is a more modern aluminum road bike. I bought this Journeyman as a commuter / possible touring bike and to replace my current day-to-day bike, a cheap Giant Defy 3 hybrid frame (with 700c tires) -- but unfortunately the Journeyman was much heavier and considerably slower. My daily commutes (about 18 miles each way on very flat Orange County bike paths) averaged several minutes slower each way on this bike than my Giant (which I picked up used for only $150) and there really was no contest when compared to my friend's budget ~$500 Fuji road bike. This was quite a disappointment given that as a gravel bike the Journeyman is touted as being equally-capable on the road. It's possible that swapping the tires for something slicker / less knobby would improve it's speed, but obviously this takes away from its off-road capabilities (unless you own a second wheelset for quick changes) and I didn't really see this as any guarantee that the bike would improve to meet my needs, as the frame itself is rather heavy. I ended up returning the bike after a few weeks (thanks to REI's generous return policy) -- it was hard to justify keeping it when it didn't perform as well as what I already had. Instead of a nice 'all-in-one' bike I think I may pick up a dedicated road bike for commuting and fitness rides and a cheaper mountain bike for playing around on the trails on the weekends.",

This has to be the most comfortable Road Bike that I've ridden by far. I'm still not accustomed to riding Road Bikes but the Journeyman does allow me to go the distance without experience too much lower back pain. I didn't used to be a fan of riding in the drops - mainly because of lower back pain - but on this bike, I did not feel any discomfort riding in the drops and it certainly makes riding into the wind much less taxing. It is not the fastest bike in my stable. The wider tires certainly creates more rolling resistance, however riding over the rough road surfaces of the Greater Cleveland Area with these wider tires creates an almost plush ride. I will gladly take the tradeoff in speed for the added comfort. I purchased this bike to use a winter commuter. It has all the braze-ons you could ever need for mounting accessories. I specifically like the braze-ons on the top tube. I mounted an anything carrier to the top tube to carry my JBL Charge 3 speaker. Perhaps my favorite thing about this bike will be the 650b tires. Because of my long legs I tend to put the seat up fairly high to allow me more power when I peddle.

I picked it up a few weeks before riding 300 plus miles and took it on single track, road and various dirt terrain. The way it handles with and without bags is amazing. Even without suspension and flat bars, I was able to rock and roll up and down some nasty gravel and dirt. The 650b set up is super soft and cruises well on all surfaces. I was curious if I would lag behind the pack on a long tour (mostly on pavement) but no complaints. The tires and drop bars make for a great ride with little to no drag.",

For the price it has more than a lot of other FS out there. However, I have only gone on two rides with this bike and I experienced the same issue. The SRAM Eagle SX derailleur keeps failing. I think they could have provided an upgraded component. Maybe a GX? I noticed that the 2019 game with a Shimano derailleur, and everyone seems to like that bike. Anyways, I took the bike back to my local REI and they fixed it the first time, tightened everything up, but still failed the next day in the middle of the trail. The guys at my local REI are awesome and are replacing it with a SRAM NX. Hopefully this works better.

After advising I should purchase a pump for the air suspension, I had a simple question for the person at the bike shop desk. “I don’t know. I’m not a mountain biker.” Was how it was answered, with no follow up. Not exactly what I expected from an REI employee. Fast forward a month and about 8 hours of trail later, the bike is almost unusable. What may be a problem with the chain is causing slippage and near constant missed shifts. Brake caliper bolts were found to be loose, judging by loctite on the threads, it seems they were never torqued or even tightened. There is creaking coming from what may be the bottom bracket and excessive side to side play in the rear wheel. I still hope to get this bike dialed in and am disappointed I need to set aside a day to bring it back and get the chain issue taken care of, just to be able to get enough time on it to make a review of the actual product, as I suspect properly assembled it would rate a 4/5.",

Handlebar is narrower (740) than I'm used to (780) which in theory should make riding through tight trees.easier, but in practice the longer bar is easier to control anyway so it's easier to lean the bike to fit through. The gear range is quite limited with only 28 front and 11-42 in the back. The brakes would probably be the first to get upgraded. Nowhere near the 1-finger ease and strong bite of the XT brakes I have on my older bike. The rear shock's metal valve sticks out just enough where you can hit your knee or thigh on it on dismounts. I have already scratched my thigh on it on the first ride. The metal is pretty sharp and is also a problem on the 3.2 bike which is basically the same frame. My son has also cut his knee on the shock valve of his 3.2. The front fork makes a loud squishing sound on quick decompression which you will hear when lifting up the front wheel to ride over logs for example. Not really that bothersome amidst all the sounds of riding on the trail. At least the tires roll relatively quietly. The cable routing with the big hanging loop under the bottom bracket looks like it could snag on rocks or logs. Haven't been a problem so far but the cables do catch a lot of mud and dirt. This is the same frame (and tires and rear shock and seatpost and seat and handlebars) as the 3.2 bike. It has modern frame geometry that would be a good base for upgrades. If you're thinking of upgrading to better than the 3.2 spec or you just like the grey/black color better, this would be the better option. If you don't have upgrade plans, the 3.2 bike would be the better choice. I think the price difference easily justifies the much better fork, and the better gearing and brakes.",

Handlebar is narrower (740) than I'm used to (780) which in theory should make riding through tight trees.easier, but in practice the longer bar is easier to control anyway so it's easier to lean the bike to fit through. The gear range is quite limited with only 28 front and 11-42 in the back. The brakes would probably be the first to get upgraded. Nowhere near the 1-finger ease and strong bite of the XT brakes I have on my older bike. The rear shock's metal valve sticks out just enough where you can hit your knee or thigh on it on dismounts. I have already scratched my thigh on it on the first ride. The metal is pretty sharp and is also a problem on the 3.2 bike which is basically the same frame. My son has also cut his knee on the shock valve of his 3.2. The front fork makes a loud squishing sound on quick decompression which you will hear when lifting up the front wheel to ride over logs for example. Not really that bothersome amidst all the sounds of riding on the trail. At least the tires roll relatively quietly. The cable routing with the big hanging loop under the bottom bracket looks like it could snag on rocks or logs. Haven't been a problem so far but the cables do catch a lot of mud and dirt. This is the same frame (and tires and rear shock and seatpost and seat and handlebars) as the 3.2 bike. It has modern frame geometry that would be a good base for upgrades. If you're thinking of upgrading to better than the 3.2 spec or you just like the grey/black color better, this would be the better option. If you don't have upgrade plans, the 3.2 bike would be the better choice. I think the price difference easily justifies the much better fork, and the better gearing and brakes.",
